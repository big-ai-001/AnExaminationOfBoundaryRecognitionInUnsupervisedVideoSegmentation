1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,030
it will change everything deep minds ai

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,430
makes gigantic leap in solving protein

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,630
structures

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,669
so i guess all of you heard about this

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,950
uh so far or most of you and

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,669
uh basically uh what happened is that

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,470
deepmind

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,990
uh released published their results uh

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,109
on this year's protein folding challenge

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,990
and their method alpha fold actually the

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,109
second iteration of

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,150
their algorithm alpha fold kind of

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,069
ruined the the whole like like

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,030
beat everybody uh and got the best

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,150
scores

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,630
and we can see so this is the the blog

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,430
that they

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,310
uh published so far they still haven't

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,510
published the paper

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,389
uh the paper will come probably in maybe

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,029
maybe even

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,229
a year or something because the the last

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,389
paper for the alpha fold one came out in

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,310
december 2019

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,470
where the competition happened in 2018

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,389
so we'll have to wait some time to get

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:00,950
to that

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,149
uh to get the paper now basically you

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,590
can see the

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,670
uh the scores throughout the years so

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,030
that's a biennial

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,310
competition called casp and it happens

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,789
so it happens every every two years and

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,910
you can see here

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,350
that uh in 2018 their method alpha fault

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,910
one

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,630
also dominated the competition but this

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,190
year

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,149
they crossed the 90 on this global

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,510
distance test

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,910
metric which pretty much tells you how

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,030
good the

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,469
uh the alignment between the

44
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,149
experimentally found uh

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,590
protein structure and the

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,270
computationally found

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,550
protein structures are and i'll i'll

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,030
first

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,789
so the idea of this video will be to

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,310
first uh

51
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,550
explain you what the problem is so what

52
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,830
the what the protein

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,550
uh folding problem is uh give you a bit

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,350
about

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,590
like history and background of how

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,510
proteins work and everything

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,990
and then my idea is to go into the alpha

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,590
fold one paper because that's what we

59
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,709
have so far

60
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,630
and i'll explain how it works how the

61
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,149
deep learning method works so there'll

62
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,109
be a deep

63
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,710
in-depth uh explanation of the paper

64
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,910
and i'll give some uh

65
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,510
assumptions of what will happen with the

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,430
alpha fault too what the method is they

67
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,869
don't only have one chart

68
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,510
so i'll try and deduce something out of

69
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,070
it

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,430
so uh basically so what why this is

71
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,309
interesting

72
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,430
uh is that uh 90 is consider

73
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,589
is considered as something that's that's

74
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,470
like if you if you get to 90 or above

75
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,830
you're pretty much uh comparable to

76
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,110
experimental methods

77
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,790
the reason being they are also not

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,869
perfect and they they do have their

79
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,630
like measuring uncertainties uh so

80
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,869
here we can see let me zoom in a bit

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,910
here we can see

82
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,710
uh like what the what the problem is

83
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,150
basically the green thing

84
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,670
is the pseudo ground truth so that means

85
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,030
uh uh somebody uh found

86
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,949
that one using some of the experimental

87
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,630
methods and i'll i'll tell you a bit

88
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,990
more about those

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,949
and the the the blue one so the blue one

90
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,550
is a computational prediction that deep

91
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,229
minds alpha fall to

92
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,710
uh made and you can see it's pretty

93
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,229
pretty close

94
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,550
uh the results are really really good

95
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,190
and you can see 90.7

96
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,509
93.3 and these are just the names of the

97
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,190
proteins t1 0

98
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,309
4 9 whatever so let me

99
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,949
uh kind of step back a little bit here

100
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,110
and tell you something about like how

101
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,990
the problem came to

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,509
be so we've been trying to solve this

103
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,390
problem in biology for 50 years already

104
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,390
and so this is kind of really big big

105
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,910
thing that happened so

106
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,350
uh yeah the hype is real this time

107
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,350
first of all there's this guy called uh

108
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,789
christian anfinsen

109
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,750
and uh you can see in 1972 he gave this

110
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,110
noble uh

111
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,550
uh nobel prize lecture so he basically

112
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,470
got his nobel prize because

113
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,509
he uh he showed that

114
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,910
the function of the protein is pretty

115
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,990
much uniquely determined by its 3d

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,949
structure

117
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,190
which is really interesting so here is a

118
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,070
really cool example of hemoglobin a

119
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,830
small molecule with an iron atom in the

120
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,750
center that binds to oxygen

121
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,390
so basically like the structure is made

122
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,270
so that

123
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,830
this protein the hemoglobin has a small

124
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,710
pocket

125
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,110
where this molecule that has a like a

126
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,629
iron

127
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,670
atom which binds to like the oxygen and

128
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,070
thus

129
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,629
transports oxygen throughout our body

130
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,430
like just

131
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,430
that molecule fits so nicely in this

132
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,030
hemoglobin so that's a

133
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,270
really plastic example of how the

134
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,230
structure

135
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,629
uh determines the the function that's a

136
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,749
pretty obvious one

137
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,270
so there's this cool example of this

138
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,189
molecule that has this y shape

139
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,230
and the molecule attaches to bacteria or

140
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,110
viruses

141
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,110
and thus tags those cells for

142
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,150
destruction in the

143
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,830
immune system so let me give you just a

144
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,749
brief example of how the proteins are

145
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,710
are created

146
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,990
so um i like to think of this as like a

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,430
as like kitchen where the ribosome

148
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,150
is basically this macromolecule acts as

149
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,950
a cook

150
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,029
we have the messenger rna which is

151
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,870
pretty much the recep

152
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,029
and then we have amino acids which are

153
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,390
the ingredients

154
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,990
which are transported by this thing

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,070
called the transport

156
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,469
rna so basically the messenger rna

157
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,550
contains this linear sequence of

158
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,670
amino acids and it gets translated

159
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,070
so it gets so the receipt gets read by

160
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,430
this ribosome

161
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,350
and we form like a chains of of proteins

162
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,150
which slowly start folding because

163
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,189
different

164
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,870
different parts different amino acids

165
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,550
have different charges and so they

166
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,350
attract or

167
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,510
or repel and thus we get that 3d

168
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,029
structure so that's basically how

169
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,110
how the how the how the protein is

170
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,629
formed and now we're

171
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,469
trying to figure out this 3d structure

172
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,830
computationally now

173
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,029
the thing is how do we how do people uh

174
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,510
find uh the 3d structures now that we

175
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,830
know that it's really important for the

176
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,590
like the uh for figuring out the

177
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,189
function of the proteins how do we find

178
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,230
the structure

179
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,550
uh of the protein so there are three

180
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,950
methods that are used uh extensively

181
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,950
in uh different labyrinth uh in

182
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,870
different labs and those are

183
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,830
mainly x-ray diffraction uh nuclear

184
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,110
magnetic resonance

185
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,150
and this electron microscopy and as you

186
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,870
can see

187
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,230
the x-ray diffraction was so far uh had

188
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,710
the the highest amount of proteins were

189
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,390
like protein structures were determined

190
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,670
using this method

191
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,070
although it does has its own flaws it

192
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,029
cannot

193
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,830
solve so depending on the size of the

194
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,550
protein

195
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,230
it has its constraints so you can solve

196
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,629
everything now these two are getting

197
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,590
more popular lately but they are still

198
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,870
super expensive

199
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,150
and really slow methods uh to to obtain

200
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,710
the

201
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,550
the 3d structure so that's why the

202
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,150
computational uh

203
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,150
biology and this these computational

204
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,589
methods for figuring out the structure

205
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,670
were so important

206
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,230
so if we take a look at this chart here

207
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,550
we can see that the number of proteins

208
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,589
we sequenced successfully sequenced uh

209
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,309
is around 200 million now in 2020. so

210
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:10,870
it's been

211
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,029
rising like so those are the linear

212
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,029
sequences that are encoded in the

213
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,749
dna so but we still don't have the 3d

214
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,950
structure for all of those

215
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,350
and if we take a look at this chart we

216
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,950
can see there is this thing called a

217
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,150
protein database

218
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,589
which is really important because that's

219
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,309
the data set that's been used in the

220
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,510
alpha fold

221
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,029
uh elf fold paper and we'll get to it

222
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,189
in a couple of minutes but basically

223
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,550
here you can see that

224
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,870
um like uh we we have

225
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,589
so we have a lot of sequences being uh

226
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,230
kind of ingested into this data set but

227
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,790
the

228
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,790
the the number of structures is actually

229
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,550
a lot smaller so here

230
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,589
2020 we can see only 12 000

231
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,309
structures are are it are there but we

232
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:58,629
only

233
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,350
but we have like much more uh sequences

234
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,749
so

235
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,909
so that there was a motivation for why

236
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,869
we wanna

237
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,670
um why we wanna accelerate the pace of

238
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,510
uh finding three structures

239
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,830
the experimental one is slow it's really

240
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,710
expensive

241
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,790
so yeah we we need we need an

242
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,749
alternative so again why we care about

243
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,150
uh figuring out the structure the 3d

244
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,909
structure of the protein

245
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,749
is because as as you can see on

246
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,150
deepmind's blog an error in the genetic

247
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,430
recipe may result in a malformed protein

248
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,909
which could result in disease or death

249
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,110
for an organism

250
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,709
many diseases therefore are

251
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,870
fundamentally linked to proteins

252
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,469
so diseases like uh diabetes

253
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,710
uh like dementia parkinson's alzheimer's

254
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,870
cancer some of the diseases that are

255
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,829
known to be

256
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,150
like plaguing the like the human kind

257
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,030
for for

258
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,550
for decades or more uh can probably be

259
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,790
solved by just

260
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,350
us knowing the 3d structures so that's

261
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,790
why it's super important to

262
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,389
so this is that's why this problem is

263
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,949
super important aside from that also

264
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,750
we could develop much better materials

265
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,310
if we

266
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,150
if we knew how to construct and

267
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,590
understand the

268
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,750
the shapes of different proteins and we

269
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,310
could create like plastic eating enzymes

270
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,550
uh and thus reduce the pollution like on

271
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,470
the on the like global level

272
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,070
uh which is something we do care about

273
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,829
obviously so that was the background

274
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,230
story

275
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,389
it was a bit longer uh i assume most of

276
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,990
my like uh audiences

277
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,230
like machine learning uh with has

278
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,590
machine learning background

279
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,310
so i felt i need to really give you a

280
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,070
nice overview what the problem is

281
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,550
and everything that goes inside and like

282
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,389
the give you some numbers and methods

283
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,030
etc

284
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,710
so let's start exploring the alpha fold

285
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,070
one now

286
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,230
as you can see here uh this is an

287
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,550
animation that deep mind provided

288
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,110
which basically shows uh how during

289
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,350
their optimization procedure which will

290
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,470
uh get you in a sec uh like falls the

291
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,269
proteins

292
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,990
so it starts from a semi like unfolded

293
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,310
uh

294
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,670
protein uh protein strand which then

295
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,710
slowly uh takes its 3d shape

296
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,910
in space okay let's overview the

297
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,430
half a fold one paper you can see

298
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,990
so the title is alpha fold improved

299
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,670
protein structure prediction

300
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,030
using potentials from deep learning

301
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,670
uh they had like a bunch of folks uh

302
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,269
working on this project as is

303
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,430
as it's pretty common for for huge

304
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,190
projects like this one

305
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,550
um so they started in 2016 so it's

306
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,389
already been like a four year effort of

307
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,990
many smart people

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,630
uh so i already mentioned it's deep mind

309
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,310
they're based in london

310
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,269
and okay so the paper is pretty

311
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,790
complicated there is a lot of text

312
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,509
and a lot of domain knowledge so i'll

313
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,430
just try and extract the deep learning

314
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,230
side of it

315
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,389
and hopefully that will give you like a

316
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,910
good understanding of how the method

317
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,790
works

318
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,630
um let's start with this chart so

319
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,069
uh basically the the on this uh

320
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,069
chart here they just show that they are

321
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,829
better than other groups so

322
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,910
many other uh research groups were

323
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,350
participating in this

324
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,389
in 2018 cusp 13

325
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,310
uh challenge that that was the name of

326
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,910
the challenge um

327
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,910
and uh basically the green lines

328
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,949
represent

329
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,750
uh the like the groups uh those other

330
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,069
groups and the blue line is deepmind

331
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,150
and so on the um basically on the x-axis

332
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,990
we have something called tm score

333
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,190
so there are a bunch of metrics for uh

334
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,430
determining how good the structure

335
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,310
prediction is

336
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,710
so one is tm uh there are other scores

337
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,949
like we saw the global distance test

338
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:43,750
score

339
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,760
uh there are some like uh

340
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,350
idd or something yeah there are a lot of

341
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,389
different scores

342
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,829
and uh basically so fm domain

343
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,190
domain is uh some like fancy name for

344
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,310
for protein pretty much um

345
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,509
so here in this free modeling domain uh

346
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,150
we have

347
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,350
uh we had 43

348
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,110
sequences which we needed to figure the

349
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,069
structure for and you can see that

350
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,110
on average uh the the deepmind had

351
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,389
a lot higher tm score than others

352
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,629
so that's what this thing is and now i

353
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,509
should probably uh

354
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,629
tell you what what the difference

355
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,389
between free modeling and template

356
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,350
modeling is

357
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,190
so template modeling is when you're

358
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,949
trying to

359
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,310
predict the structure for a sequence uh

360
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,870
that has similar sequences whose

361
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,550
structure we already know

362
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,590
now uh the thing is once you know

363
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,629
uh some some similar sequence

364
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,670
uh you can kind of uh

365
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,150
assume that the structure of your of

366
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,269
your sequence

367
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,990
will be similar to that one so you just

368
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,949
need to find

369
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,310
where the like the sequence differs and

370
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,030
tweak uh kind of tweak the the structure

371
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,550
so starting from that maybe that

372
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,310
structure so that's a template modeling

373
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,350
so i'm

374
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,269
simplifying a little bit here but like

375
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,110
that's that's the rough notion

376
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,230
again here on this chart they

377
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,350
just displayed uh five different

378
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,150
proteins and they again showed that like

379
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,389
the blue dots that deepmind is

380
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,430
uh crushing it i mean the so these two

381
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,310
were bragging

382
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,550
charts so now now let's get to to the

383
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,030
actual uh the actual method

384
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,990
and this is how it looks like we can see

385
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,389
some

386
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,870
um neural network here of course and

387
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,750
that's actually

388
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,670
uh resnet with dilated convolutions

389
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,710
and so basically before i get into those

390
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,550
details they're they're pretty much

391
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,150
um let me see three parts of this

392
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,269
pipeline

393
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,670
so the first one is preparing uh the

394
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,030
features

395
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,069
that we'll need in order to predict the

396
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,590
structure

397
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,110
then the second part is the

398
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,550
distance and uh torsion angle

399
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,310
predictions and i'll tell you what those

400
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,629
are

401
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,470
in in a minute so there's the second

402
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,069
part of pipeline and then we have the

403
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:10,710
gradient

404
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,590
uh descent uh or the non-linear

405
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,470
optimization

406
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,910
part of the pipeline so in stage one

407
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,629
they uh they somehow find a way to go

408
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,590
from 1d

409
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,750
amino acid sequence that represents the

410
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,870
protein

411
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,990
to 2d uh to the map

412
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,189
and the 2d map actually contains

413
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,389
co-variations between our targeting

414
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,590
sequence and similar sequence from this

415
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:37,990
uh

416
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,550
huge data set of sequences and so this

417
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,509
is the this

418
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,990
thing called multi-sequence alignment so

419
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,910
you basically find

420
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,829
a group of sequences like thousand

421
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,030
sequences which

422
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,949
which are similar to your target

423
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,310
sequence which you're trying to

424
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,189
predict the structure for and you encode

425
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,629
the covariations

426
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,150
in these maps so if i take one uh

427
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,790
point on this 2d map and this is to the

428
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,509
volume so

429
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,389
this will be like like 500 or something

430
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,750
channels or more

431
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,829
there are some details down in the paper

432
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,949
so

433
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,590
one thing they encode is like the one

434
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,949
hot encoding of the

435
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,389
amino amino acid so basically

436
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,750
uh that means that if we take this point

437
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,470
so that's

438
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,389
let me zoom in so oops so basically uh

439
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,430
let's say this is

440
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,749
like uh row five and let's say this is

441
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,870
like row

442
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,150
i don't know 40. um they'll basically

443
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,120
uh encode five as as a one

444
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,910
they'll basically find what the fifth

445
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,269
amino acid is

446
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,670
and because we have only 21 amino acids

447
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,389
in human

448
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,829
in human uh genome we'll we'll we'll

449
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,629
encode

450
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,829
this let's say this is because because

451
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,670
there are 21 we can

452
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,509
represent each one with the letter from

453
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,509
the alphabet uh

454
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,550
luckily we have 26 letters so let's say

455
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,350
this one is

456
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,590
i don't know the fifth one is amino acid

457
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,550
a uh

458
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,670
this uh 40th is maybe i don't know

459
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,870
like s and they just encode this one

460
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,949
as as a one hot let's say this one will

461
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:17,990
be like

462
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,470
zeros and then on some spot like 13 i

463
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,030
don't know

464
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,509
they'll have one et cetera so what they

465
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,150
will do

466
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,509
is they will concatenate this one hot

467
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,310
vector

468
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,430
with one hot vector that uh corresponds

469
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:31,990
to

470
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,030
amino acid a and there will be

471
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,670
a part of the features they are using

472
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,949
there is a much more

473
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,829
uh like domain domain specific things

474
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,030
they're including

475
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,949
also they're including these uh

476
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,189
multi-sequence alignment things

477
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,910
and i'll probably explain those a bit a

478
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,550
bit more

479
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,389
i'll go into detail about those because

480
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,710
that's interesting a bit later

481
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,910
so that's that's how they get the this

482
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,949
uh

483
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,710
3d volume uh and now you can treat this

484
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,029
as a simple computer vision problem and

485
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,549
they pretty much use this

486
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,510
uh uh like classic uh deep learning

487
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,510
model like resnet with the dilated

488
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,710
convolutions

489
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,870
uh and treat this as a sequel like an

490
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,829
image to image

491
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,510
uh translation problem so uh the network

492
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,309
itself is

493
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,630
as you can see has kernels a site of

494
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,630
size 64 by 64.

495
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,110
so they're just actually randomly

496
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,750
sliding

497
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,110
across this volume and they end up

498
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,510
getting the distance predictions okay so

499
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,190
what is this distance map

500
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,669
and how do we get one so in order to

501
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,549
understand that

502
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,909
i have to make a small tangent here and

503
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,350
explain how the amino acids connect and

504
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,390
uh

505
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,310
which distances and torsion angles are

506
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,990
we actually measuring so

507
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,270
uh so these are all the 21 amino acids

508
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,310
we have in

509
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,350
in the human in the human genome and

510
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,270
basically

511
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,150
so as you can see this part is always

512
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,029
always the same

513
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,750
for every single amino acid no matter uh

514
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,750
the properties this group always

515
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,789
this part always remains the same so

516
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,710
uh this thing here is called something

517
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,310
called like i think

518
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,590
alpha uh alpha carbon atom this one is

519
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:17,990
called

520
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,870
beta carbon atom and that one is really

521
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,510
important

522
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,789
so uh let's say for the sake of argument

523
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,470
that we have a sequence

524
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,710
like r h

525
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,230
k which is pretty much these three amino

526
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,029
acids here

527
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,990
so what will happen is uh once they

528
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,830
start going through the ribosome they'll

529
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,029
start connecting

530
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,909
and so these parts will form the

531
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:44,950
backbone

532
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,870
so these parts and the groups

533
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,950
which is this part that goes off from

534
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,190
the from the beta carbon

535
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,590
atom those will be like for example

536
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,990
some will be positively charged maybe

537
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,950
this one

538
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,390
uh will be negatively charged

539
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,630
so what will happen is that they'll

540
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,110
start attracting

541
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,990
and that's the thing that co that causes

542
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,630
the

543
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,270
uh the protein to fold so imagine if you

544
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,310
had like a

545
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,350
protein that had 140 amino acids so

546
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,310
what what could happen is that in this

547
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,950
complex

548
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,070
um like interaction uh maybe

549
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,350
the first maybe the the the the the

550
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,909
first

551
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,870
amino acid would be like uh in the 3d

552
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,590
structure would be really close to maybe

553
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,830
127th

554
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,909
amino acid so that means we have a long

555
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,590
range dependencies

556
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,270
uh in this in this structure so now

557
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,549
uh when we are so i mentioned distance

558
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,190
map

559
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,230
so what we are actually uh looking for

560
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,430
is uh distance between beta carbon atoms

561
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,310
between different

562
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,750
amino acids so basically um

563
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,270
that's that's what that's what we're

564
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,870
looking at and then we have

565
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,149
uh torsion angles so uh phi

566
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,909
and psi angles which are um

567
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,230
basically in that 3d structure two

568
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,909
angles that we care about let me see if

569
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,510
i can

570
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,270
find a nice visualization of that

571
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,549
and you can see it here hopefully

572
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,159
let me zoom in so this is the

573
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,590
protein chain and so

574
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,789
one of the two dihedral

575
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,590
angles inside here without getting into

576
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,270
uh too much explanation

577
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,590
is two angles that we care about so for

578
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,190
the sake of argument just think

579
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,190
there are two angles we care about there

580
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,310
is third but

581
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,789
that one is almost always 180 so deep

582
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,470
deepmind kind of

583
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,789
hardcoded that one to be 180 and they're

584
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,310
just considering

585
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,830
these two so okay let me get back to the

586
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,320
onenote

587
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,990
so now that we know uh this information

588
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,070
about how we calculate distance and phi

589
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,390
and psi angles let's go back to the

590
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,510
deep learning pipeline so

591
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,549
uh basically you can see here uh we have

592
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,870
we we have um amino acids here

593
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,909
and we we have the same sequence here

594
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,789
and so this particular point maybe

595
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,669
corresponds

596
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,909
uh to uh finding the

597
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,390
so i'll actually use a different drawing

598
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,070
which will probably be a bit

599
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,070
easier to understand okay let me see if

600
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,430
i can nicely explain

601
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,990
the distance maps um so we have

602
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,310
the experimentally found

603
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,310
the pseudo ground truth uh distance map

604
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,190
for this particular amino acid sequence

605
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,390
and we have the predicted uh

606
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,669
distance map uh over here

607
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,789
so basically what they showed here is

608
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,590
they took

609
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,510
a specific amino acid from the sequence

610
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,870
like uh

611
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,390
in particular they took 29th amino acid

612
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,350
and that's uh depicted on these charts

613
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,990
by these

614
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,750
uh red uh stripes

615
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,830
and um basically uh you can see

616
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,190
that the distance between 29th

617
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,789
uh carbon uh uh beta carbon

618
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,990
and um with itself is

619
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,270
obviously zero which is this colored

620
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,870
with yellow

621
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,630
and over the whole main diagonal

622
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,630
is going to be yellow for that specific

623
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,070
for that particular reason

624
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,390
because um the distance between a beta

625
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,390
carbon and itself is always going to be

626
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,870
zero

627
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,950
so that's why we see this pattern along

628
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,830
the main diagonal

629
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,830
and what it did here is

630
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,870
uh they took they took uh

631
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,909
the neighborhood uh

632
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,360
for from the 29th

633
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,270
amino acid and they just extracted all

634
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,270
of the 41

635
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,310
distances and that's the chart on the

636
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,870
right

637
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,430
and now the thing is uh these things

638
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,270
here are not scalars

639
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,549
they're actually probability

640
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,789
distributions so if we take

641
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,400
maybe i don't know 40th

642
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,190
probability distribution 40th amino acid

643
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,830
and its corresponding probability

644
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,590
distribution

645
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,549
we end up with something like this and

646
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,630
you can see on the x-axis

647
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,590
we have the distance and on the y-axis

648
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,789
we have the probability

649
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,630
so this particular um

650
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,909
like uh position

651
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,470
has uh we can see that the distribution

652
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,029
is

653
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,909
somewhere like the peak is pretty much

654
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:58,870
around like

655
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,070
four angstroms where angstrom is 0.1

656
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,510
um nanometer so this is how they

657
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,549
uh symbolize the angstrom and

658
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,669
the red bar is the ground truth value so

659
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,390
the red bar

660
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,630
says i don't know like five and we

661
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,669
predicted four

662
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,310
which is pretty good if we take a look

663
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,789
at

664
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,590
because 29 is missing obviously because

665
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,549
we know that

666
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,669
is going to have a spike on the zero uh

667
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,950
distance basically if we take a look at

668
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,710
the surrounding

669
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,110
probability distributions so those are

670
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,070
those correspond

671
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,669
to this part here um basically

672
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,950
distributions are really narrow and uh

673
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,110
really precise so you can see that the

674
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,029
peak the mode of the distribution

675
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,990
corresponds perfectly to the red bars

676
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,350
here also

677
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,070
really nice as we go further apart

678
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,110
further away

679
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,549
uh we can see that um the

680
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,110
red bars don't correspond always with

681
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,470
the like with the mode of the

682
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,590
distribution

683
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,350
so say let me take an example

684
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,470
where we have some problems like here

685
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,669
like this one is a good example because

686
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,950
uh we predicted that the

687
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,110
distance is here so that's whatever this

688
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,990
value is

689
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,350
but the red bar is here so yeah um

690
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,549
by the way these black lines um

691
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,789
is the kind of uh length distance

692
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,710
uh when we consider the the the two

693
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,750
carbon um beta carbon atoms

694
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,549
to be in contact so if we are so this

695
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,029
one is

696
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,230
at eighth angstrom so if you fall below

697
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,310
eight angstrom we consider those two

698
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,950
beta carbon atoms to be in contact

699
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,230
otherwise they are

700
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,590
they are not uh in contact obviously so

701
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,470
those are basically uh so the map is

702
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,909
basically the

703
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,029
like the inter residue distances

704
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,870
for the amino sequence

705
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,990
and we want to predict obviously uh as

706
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,909
close as possible to the ground truth

707
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,630
so let me now go back to our initial

708
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,149
deploying pipeline if i can

709
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,830
get there okay we're here

710
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,630
so we we do a similar thing for for the

711
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,669
uh for torsion

712
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,789
angles and once we have those maps uh

713
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,070
what we now do

714
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,230
is we uh form a geometric model

715
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,029
of the of our sequence meaning uh we

716
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:31,990
basically take

717
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,190
uh like we have a geometric model and we

718
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,950
have two arguments we have

719
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,350
the phi and we have psi

720
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,830
so the torsion angles and those gives us

721
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,390
give us

722
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,870
the like 3d coordinates of those

723
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,230
beta carbon atoms in 3d space

724
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,230
so what i mean by that so if we have us

725
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,990
like a sequence of length

726
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,029
100 we'll have

727
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,070
200 parameters here

728
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,630
and uh basically for one specific

729
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,230
configuration of these

730
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,070
2l torsion angles we get a

731
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,070
we get a specific configuration in 3d

732
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,350
space like i don't know

733
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,390
like we will have some thing going on in

734
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,470
space

735
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,990
and uh so what this part does is we are

736
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,389
optimizing so we are changing

737
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,990
these two so that uh

738
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,710
the 3d coordinates or the corresponding

739
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,990
3d structure

740
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,350
gets as close as possible to

741
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,710
uh the to the gray one so that this one

742
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,750
is the native

743
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,950
experimentally found structure so

744
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,990
what happens is by tweaking these phi

745
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,029
and psi angles we are also tweaking you

746
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,630
can you can imagine like we are tweaking

747
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,070
the distance map

748
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,470
for this particular configuration so for

749
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,110
a given

750
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,710
phi and psi we have a given distance map

751
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,669
uh which which uh which we are trying to

752
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:01,990
uh

753
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,350
to uh to match with this one so the two

754
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,710
parts of the pipeline are pretty much

755
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,750
independent

756
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,830
the second pipeline so the second part

757
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,870
of pipeline just

758
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,310
figures out uh figures out the depth map

759
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,950
and the torsion maps and then the the

760
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,389
the third part

761
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,830
uh of the pipeline uh just tries and

762
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,029
tweaks this differentiable g model

763
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,269
so that we uh minimize the distance

764
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,470
and we can see on this chart here

765
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,110
that the tm score as we are it did i'm

766
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,549
losing my cursor my god

767
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,070
uh the team score is going uh uh down as

768
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,389
we

769
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,310
are progressing with our optimization

770
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,389
steps and uh

771
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,310
sorry that the the rmsd that's the uh

772
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,310
one one of the metrics that they use to

773
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,870
figure out whether the 3d structures are

774
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,430
are like uh getting closer together and

775
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,950
the tm score on the other

776
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,630
hand is going upwards

777
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,149
what's else interesting so they just

778
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,909
took a snapshot here

779
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,230
and we can we can see how the how it's

780
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,230
progressing and slowly getting into the

781
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,990
final shape which is really close to the

782
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,310
gray one here

783
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,190
now the interesting thing is uh the and

784
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,549
i didn't mention this

785
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,870
because those details were probably not

786
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,470
as relevant as now

787
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,750
uh so the the protein has uh something

788
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,389
called

789
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,470
the the primary the secondary the

790
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,870
tertiary and the coronary

791
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,720
like uh structure

792
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,549
the primary structure is just the amino

793
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,310
sequence the secondary structure are

794
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,350
those

795
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,070
things that form spontaneously like the

796
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,789
this thing

797
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,549
it's called alpha helix and then we have

798
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,070
uh these things here which are called

799
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,669
beta sheets and uh then those are

800
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,669
forming in these intricate

801
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,909
like shapes which are the tertiary

802
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,510
structure of the protein

803
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,909
and finally the the quarter

804
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,389
tertiary quad coronary let me actually

805
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,669
use uh

806
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,110
this shot it will be easier to

807
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,470
understand what i'm talking about so we

808
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:08,950
have

809
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,669
the primary structure here uh then we

810
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,669
have the secondary structures which form

811
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,070
so alpha helixes and these pleity or

812
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,430
beta sheets

813
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,909
then they form in this thing called like

814
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,190
the tertiary structure

815
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,230
and finally multiple proteins can

816
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,710
interact and that's the the coordinate

817
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,070
structure i hope i'm pronouncing

818
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,269
pronouncing that well

819
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,870
so that's about the the shapes and

820
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,510
aside from the the distance map i

821
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:35,990
already

822
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,269
showed you um uh this pipeline is also

823
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:39,830
predicting

824
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,870
uh these secondary shapes so the the

825
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,149
the blue one is the uh the the the alpha

826
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,990
helix and the red one

827
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,350
is the beta the beta

828
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,789
beta beta sheet

829
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,590
so this is the ground truth the suit of

830
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,269
ground truth

831
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,549
and these here are

832
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,669
taken is a snapshot taken from the last

833
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,990
optimization step and we can see that

834
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,269
the modes

835
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,990
uh pretty much uh we are pretty pretty

836
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,549
uh

837
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,870
well correlated with the ground truth

838
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,830
and thus

839
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,840
the final 3d shape is also

840
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,789
also coincides with the experimentally

841
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,279
found shape

842
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,029
there was there was uh that was

843
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,430
that was crazy now there is one more

844
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,590
question how do we initialize the

845
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,630
the files and the size initially uh

846
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,430
and what they did is they they use those

847
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:39,830
uh

848
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,990
predicted torsion angles which are not

849
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,269
depicted here they only show the

850
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,310
distance map

851
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,789
and they sample from those distributions

852
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,070
to get the initial

853
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,350
like uh uh configuration you can see it

854
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,750
here

855
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,950
this is the initial one and uh

856
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,750
it's getting crowded here um so

857
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,190
basically

858
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,710
that's how they initialize this they

859
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,870
randomly sample from that distribution

860
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,950
and then they do the optimization but

861
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,710
now uh what they

862
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,870
what they do they do one more thing

863
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,750
that's they

864
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,789
they keep a pool of um

865
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,509
a final structures so they keep like a

866
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,389
20

867
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,509
uh final structures so uh whatever they

868
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,149
get

869
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,509
at the end of these optimization

870
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,269
procedures uh

871
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,870
they minimize the potential and they

872
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,389
just keep those uh

873
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,750
in this pool and then they also sample

874
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,509
from deadpool so they take one of these

875
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,269
minimal configurations

876
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,149
and they randomly add noise to files and

877
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:36,870
size

878
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,470
so they kind of uh get uh

879
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,669
experimentally showed that they are

880
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,350
getting those are giving them better

881
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,789
initializations than just randomly

882
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,149
sampling from those

883
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,789
torsion angle maps so that's one more

884
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,630
detail i wanted to mention

885
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,789
and now we have the whole pipeline

886
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,470
hopefully uh

887
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,110
in place let me go once more uh like the

888
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,549
high level thing

889
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,549
we have the features related to amino

890
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,950
acids we do uh

891
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,389
basically convolutions uh over uh over

892
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,029
those

893
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,389
uh input maps we get the distance maps

894
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,909
we get the torsion angles

895
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,070
we get these uh secondary structure

896
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,669
predictions

897
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,029
and once we have those we we just freeze

898
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:21,509
it

899
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,830
and then we have an independent step and

900
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,269
that's the gradient descent

901
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,630
optimization uh they used lbfgs actually

902
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,909
forgot to mention that detail and they

903
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,750
basically are tweaking the files and

904
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,230
size so that the geometric model the 3d

905
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,110
coordinates

906
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,750
are getting in a configuration which

907
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,350
will produce

908
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,750
distance maps similar to the one that we

909
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,120
got that we got here

910
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,909
so that's a high level overview of how

911
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,039
it all fits together

912
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,870
okay that was the overview of the alpha

913
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,870
fold one uh hopefully that was

914
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,870
useful i know there was a lot of details

915
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,950
um let that sink in

916
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,230
um so regarding the alpha fault two

917
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,629
uh that's the main topic today but uh we

918
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,750
don't know much

919
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,389
so this is what we what we got from from

920
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,190
deepmind

921
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,790
so we trained this system on public

922
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,589
available data consisting of 170

923
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,349
000 protein structures from the protein

924
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,710
data bank so

925
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,109
we already mentioned this one uh

926
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,589
together with large bases blah blah blah

927
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,190
and so they they used um

928
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,790
128 tpuv3 cores for for maybe a couple

929
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,470
of weeks to train this thing

930
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,750
and um basically this is

931
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,310
this is the the diagram they gave us uh

932
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,869
and

933
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,750
the paper so uh they are preparing a

934
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,470
paper

935
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,950
uh to submit for a peer-reviewed uh

936
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,550
journal and

937
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,470
let me let me let me see what i can

938
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,069
deduce from from this

939
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,669
chart alone so basically um

940
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,670
what i expect here and they mean they

941
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,230
mention spatial graphs in the blog

942
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,510
so i won't get into any assumptions

943
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,150
aside from from from this one once the

944
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,630
paper

945
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,829
comes out i'll i'll i'll cover it but

946
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,520
for now let me just um

947
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,390
try and see what we can deduce here so

948
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,470
basically what i expect to happen

949
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,550
is because they were using um like uh

950
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,950
only 40 46 64 by 64

951
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,230
uh comp maps here is that

952
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,190
so basically you have the amino sequence

953
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,069
that's a bad

954
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,670
depiction of amino sequence and

955
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,750
basically until now they could only

956
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,430
model uh

957
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,230
they could model the long range like

958
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,990
throughout the sequence they could only

959
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,950
take chunks so so it's basically a form

960
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,589
of local

961
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,990
attention so um they could maybe model

962
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,270
uh like uh amino acids that

963
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,390
like close together if we are on the uh

964
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,510
main diagonal here so that's

965
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,470
so if we if if the com map is currently

966
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,630
maybe here

967
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,950
that's when we model that's when we

968
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,310
modeled uh

969
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,349
like the like uh local

970
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,150
local attention of of of close by uh

971
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,190
amino acids

972
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,190
if the uh if the comp map is maybe here

973
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,800
then what happens is the following

974
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,270
we can model maybe this group

975
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,310
and this group and all the interactions

976
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,109
between them

977
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,349
like this one corresponds to this one

978
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,550
and this one

979
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,589
etc so it becomes a mess really quick

980
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,670
but uh basically what i expect they will

981
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,750
do is they will use transformers

982
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,510
and they'll just have so their other use

983
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,390
they'll probably use some some efficient

984
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,190
transformer

985
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,589
a lot of them came out this year like uh

986
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,150
i know informer performer reformer

987
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,870
fill in the blank uh and basically uh

988
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,670
they'll

989
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,270
um they won't have to to create these

990
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,430
inductive biases that we currently have

991
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,190
and that's the like the intrinsic

992
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,630
property of convolutional neural

993
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,310
networks

994
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,790
um yeah that was that was it about the

995
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,790
the the second paper i won't get into

996
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,030
any more details i just want to uh tell

997
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,910
you about some

998
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,790
really cool repercussions uh that the

999
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,750
system will have

1000
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,829
uh in the like uh cavite 19 pandemic

1001
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,950
so basically they already helped

1002
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,829
us find structures of certain proteins

1003
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:34,310
uh

1004
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,829
that we that we that are present in

1005
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,310
in the in the source code of two virus

1006
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,630
one of those is orf-3a protein and

1007
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,390
what they can do is they can accelerate

1008
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,470
the pace of experimental methods

1009
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,910
they can they can predict the structure

1010
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,589
and then they can help the

1011
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,109
experimentation labs

1012
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,950
figure out the structure much faster

1013
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,950
than by doing it from scratch

1014
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,150
so yeah that was that was

1015
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,109
that was it uh hopefully uh you found

1016
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,710
this video insightful
